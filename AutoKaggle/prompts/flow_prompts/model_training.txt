Now we move to Model Training:
Training the selected machine learning models using the training dataset.
Tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Employing techniques like cross-validation to assess model generalization and prevent overfitting.
Evaluating model performance on the validation set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
The dataframe is already split into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test. 
Please write a function that receives X_train, y_train. 
The function trains all models using some gridsearch with different hyperparameters. 
The function should return an object of the best model.
