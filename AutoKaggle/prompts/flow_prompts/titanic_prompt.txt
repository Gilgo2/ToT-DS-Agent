Variable Notes
Pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower
Age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
Sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)
Parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
I have already loaded this data into a pandas dataframe named pdf.
This is a classification problem to predict surival on the Titanic.
