Great now we move to model selection, keep in mind our problems and the following description Model Selection:
Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the problem type (e.g., classification, regression) and dataset characteristics.
Considering various algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, etc.
Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms and how they relate to the problem at hand.
please write a function that returns a list of suiting and initialized machine learning models from the sklearn package and saves it into a variable called models.
You should return a list of models with a suiting type either classification or regression, not both.
