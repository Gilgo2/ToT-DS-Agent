Please provide a function that receives a dataframe named pdf and returns a string that explains each variable.
The function should do Data Exploration and Understanding:
1. Explore the dataset's structure, features, and target variable.
2. Understand the distribution of features and the target variable.
3. Identify any missing or erroneous data.
This output will be used for feature engineering and should contain useful information about each feature
The function should have no prints and return a string summary output.
Identify all categorial and numerical features.
Do not use interactive charts as you will need to interpret them.
